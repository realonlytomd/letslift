  <!-- This div holds the code to play audio while the user is resting between sets.
    IOS seems to limit sound in an app to be only played if the user initiates the sound,
    as in through a click event. I could accomplish this by playing a sound file that counts
    after the user hits the Set button, but then they couldn't listen to music at the same time.
    I've chosen to leave it as is, so only Android users will hear the time elapsed 
    during rest phases.-->

            <h2>Each individualized workout consists of exercises, the weight used, 
              number of sets in each exercise, and the number of repetitions (reps) during each set.
              The app allows you to keep track of sets completed and the rest time between sets during a workout.</h2>
            <h3><b>The Process</b></h3><br>
            <p>Log in with your email address and password.<br>
              Click: <b>Click here to enter a new workout.</b><br>
              Create a name for your new workout.<br>
              Click: <b>Submit</b><br>
              You will see a form to build your first exercise. Enter the required information 
              in the fields.<br>
              Click: <b>Submit</b><br>
              To enter more exercises, click: <b>Add More Exercises</b> and repeat the sequence.<br>
              When you're finished, click: <b>Finish</b><br>
              Your new workout is then added to the list of available workouts.<br>
              Note: You are allowed 5 workouts with 10 exercises each. <br><br>
              <h4><b>Edit</b></h4>
              The <b>Edit</b> button shows the full workout of ten exercises with input fields 
              that allow changes to the workout.<br>
              Each field is labeled with the current information.<br>
              You can add more exercises to your workout in the fields with empty labels (up to a total of ten).<br>
              To save your changes for each exercise, click: <b>Submit Changes For This Exercise</b>. 
              The input fields will then display the changes that you made.<br>
              Continue editing your exercises, submitting the changes for each exercise.<br>
              <b>IMPORTANT:</b> When you complete your editing, you <b>MUST</b> click: <b>Finished Editing</b> at the bottom.<br>
              You will return to the list of available workouts.<br><br>
              <h4><b>Delete:</b></h4>
              To delete a workout, click: <b>Delete</b>.<br>
              <b>IMPORTANT:</b> This action can not be reversed!<br><br>
              <h4><b>Workout</b></h4>
              Click on the name of your chosen workout to start your session.<br>
              This page shows the <b>Name</b> of your current workout, and then a list of each <b>Exercise Name</b>,
              the associated number of <b>Sets</b> and <b>Reps</b>, and the assigned <b>Weight</b>.<br>
              A row of yellow buttons labelled <b>Reps</b> represent each set for each exercise. 
              Example: Five sets will have five buttons.<br>
              Perform your first set. Then click: <b>the first button</b>.<br>
              The <b>Reps</b> label of the button will change to the number of assigned reps for that exercise, 
              showing that you have completed the required number of reps.<br>
              The button <b>changes color to red</b> to show that you've completed that set.<br>
              <b>Note:</b> The clock starts counting your rest time between sets. <b>Pay attention so 
                you don't rest too long!</b>
              (Android users will hear the elapsed time every thirty seconds.)<br>
              When you're ready, complete your next set, and click: <b>the 
              second button</b>. The clock starts over.<br>
              Complete your entire workout, checking off each set as you finish them.<br>
              <b>Note:</b> If you can't complete the required number of reps, click: 
              <b>the same set button</b> again. The label will count down 
              to however many reps you did complete. If you click the button too many
              times, just click repeatedly to count down to zero and start over. Stop
              when it displays the correct number of completed reps.<br>
              The clock continues to count while correcting the number of reps completed!
            </p>
            <h4>When you are finished with your workout, congratulate yourself!<br>
              Click: <b>Workout Finished</b>. You'll be taken back to the list of available Workouts.<br>
