  <!-- This div holds the code to play audio while the user is resting between sets.
    IOS seems to limit sound in an app to be only played if the user initiates the sound,
    as in through a click event. I could accomplish this by playing a sound file that counts
    after the user hits the Set button, but then they couldn't listen to music at the same time.
    I've chosen to leave it as is, so only Android users will hear the time elapsed 
    during rest phases.-->

            <h2>Workouts consist of exercises, the weight used, 
              number of sets in each exercise, and the number of repetitions (reps) during each set.
              You track sets completed and the rest time between sets.</h2><br>

              Click: <b>Submit</b><br>
              A form to build your first exercise appears. Enter the required information 
              in the fields.<br>
              Click: <b>Submit</b><br>
              Enter more exercises. Click: <b>Add More Exercises</b> and repeat the sequence.<br>
              Quit entering more exercises. Click: <b>Finish</b>.<br>
              Your new workout is then added to the list of available workouts.<br>
              Note: You are allowed 5 workouts with 10 exercises each. <br><br>
              <h4><b>Edit</b></h4>
              The <b>Edit</b> button shows the full workout of ten exercises. Change the workout
              by entering new information in the input fields.<br>
              Each field is labeled with the current exercise information.<br>
              Add more exercises in the fields with empty labels (up to a total of ten).<br>
              Save your changes for each exercise. Click: <b>Submit Changes For This Exercise</b>. 
              The input fields then display the changes that you just made.<br>
              <b>IMPORTANT:</b> When finished editing, you <b>MUST</b> click: <b>Finished Editing</b> at the bottom.<br>
              You will return to the list of available workouts.<br><br>
              <h4><b>Delete</b></h4>
              To delete a workout, click: <b>Delete</b>.<br>
              <b>IMPORTANT:</b> This action cannot be reversed!<br><br>
              <h4><b>Workout</b></h4>
              Click: the <b>name of your chosen workout</b> to start your session.<br>
              You're shown the <b>Name</b> of your current workout, and then a list of each <b>Exercise Name</b>,
              the associated number of <b>Sets</b> and <b>Reps</b>, and the assigned <b>Weight</b>.<br>
              A row of yellow buttons labelled <b>Reps</b> represent each set for each exercise. 
              Example: Five sets will have five buttons.<br>
              Perform your first set. Then click: <b>the first button</b>.<br>
              The <b>Reps</b> label of the button changes to the number of assigned reps for that exercise;
              this shows that you completed the required number of reps.<br>
              The button <b>changes color to red</b> to show you've completed that set.<br>
              <b>Note:</b> The clock starts counting your rest time between sets. <b>Pay attention so 
                you don't rest too long!</b>
              (Android users will hear the elapsed time every thirty seconds.)<br>
              When you're ready, perform your next set, and click: <b>the 
              second button</b>. The clock starts over.<br>
              Complete your entire workout, clicking each set button after you do a set.<br>
              <b>Note:</b> If you can't complete the required number of reps, click: 
              <b>the same set button</b> again. The label counts down with each click
              to the number of reps you did complete. If you click the button too many
              times, just click repeatedly to count down to zero and start over. Stop
              when it displays the correct number of completed reps.<br>
              The clock continues to count while correcting the number of reps completed.
            </p>
