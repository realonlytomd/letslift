  <!-- This div holds the code to play audio while the user is resting between sets.
    IOS seems to limit sound in an app to be only played if the user initiates the sound,
    as in through a click event. I could accomplish this by playing a sound file that counts
    after the user hits the Set button, but then they couldn't listen to music at the same time.
    I've chosen to leave it as is, so only Android users will hear the time elapsed 
    during rest phases.-->

            <h2>Each individualized workout consists of exercises, the weight used, 
              number of sets in each exercise, and the number of repetitions (reps) during each set.
              The app allows you to keep track of sets completed and the rest time between sets during a workout.</h2>
            <h3><b>The Process:</b></h3>
            <p>Log in with your email address and password.<br>
              Click: <b>Click here to enter a new workout.</b><br>
              Create a name for your new workout.<br>
              Click: <b>Submit</b><br>
              You will see a form to build your first exercise. Enter the required information 
              in the fields.<br>
              Click: <b>Submit</b><br>
              To enter more exercises, click: <b>Add More Exercises</b> and repeat the sequence.<br>
              When you're finished, click: <b>Finish</b><br>
              Your new workout is then added to the list of available workouts.<br>
              Note: You are allowed 5 workouts with 10 exercises each. <br>
              <h4><b>Edit:</b></h4>this is as far as I got with Dawn's edits.
              The Edit button shows you the full workout with input fields that allow you to alter or add to
              the workout. Each field is labeled with what's currently in your workout. 
              To save your changes for each exercise, select the "Submit Changes For This Exercise" button. 
              The input fields then display the changes that you made.<br>
              Continue editing your exercises, submitting the changes for each exercise.<br>
              IMPORTANT: When you complete your editing, you MUST click the Finished Editing button at the bottom.<br>
              You will return to the list of available workouts.<br>
              <h4><b>Delete:</b></h4>
              You may delete a workout by clicking the Delete button under each individual
              workout. Careful: this action can not be reversed!<br>
              <h4><b>Workout:</b></h4>
              Click on the name of the workout to start your session.
              You'll see the title of your current workout, and then a list of each exercise name,
              the associated number of sets and reps, and the assigned weight.<br>
              A row of buttons represent each set. After finishing the first set, click the first button.<br>
              The "Reps" label of the button will change to the number of assigned reps for that exercise, 
              and the button changes color to show that you've completed that set.<br>
              The clock automatically starts counting your rest time between sets. 
              Android users will hear the elapsed time every thirty seconds.  
              When you're ready, complete your next set, and click the 
              second button.<br>
              Complete your entire workout, checking off each set as you finish them.<br>
              If you don't complete the required number of reps, click the same button again will count down 
              to however many reps you did complete. If you click the button too many
              times, just keep clicking to count down to zero and start over. Stop
              when it displays the correct number of completed reps.<br>
              Note: the clock continues to count while correcting the number of reps completed!
            </p>
            <h4>When you are finished with your workout, congratulate yourself! Then hit the Workout Finished button at 
              the bottom of the workout and log out.</h4>
